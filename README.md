The project documents the analysis of a phishing email from one of my pwnd email accounts. The goal was to simulate an SOC analyst workflow, including collecting artifacts and writing an incident response.

Objectives
  1. Analyze a suspected phishing email
  2. Identify the artifacts (using Whois Lookup, Virus Tool, Abuseipdb, Browserling, Cisco Tallos Intelligence Group)
  3. Document the findings

I am not an SOC Analyst, but would love to be one!
